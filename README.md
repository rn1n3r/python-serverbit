Fork of BITalinoWorld/python-serverbit, by Hugo Silva. 

For Hack Western 2, this project was my attempt to get the Python API and twisted server working with my BITalino board.

Changes: changed the output of the data from the board to be drawn with smoothie.js, to allow for better real-time visualization.
